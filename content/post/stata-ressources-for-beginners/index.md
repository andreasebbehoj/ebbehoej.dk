Whatever the question, "Google" is usually the answer. But here are some other great guides and ressources that I use a lot.



**Stata cheat sheets**

The best overview of (almost) all commands you are going to need. Commands are neetly sorted in the different steps most analyses consists of: 

1) Data processing. i.e. importing data, exploring data for errors, removing duplicates, making new variables etc. 

2) Data transformation: Removing variables, labeling data, correcting errors, summarizing variables and generating new ones. And how to merge (combine) two data sets. Oh merging...

3) Data visualization: Scatter plots (ie. XY-plots), histograms, bar charts, boxplots, how to combine graphs, and the list goes on.
