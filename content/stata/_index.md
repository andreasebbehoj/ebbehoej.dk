Over the last five years, I have spend quite a lot of my time working (read: struggling) with Stata. In the beginning it was a struggle. Over time it became almost a hobby. Here I will share some of the tips, tricks, and do-files, I picked up along the way. Please let me know if you have suggestions, spot errors or perhaps even find it useful.
